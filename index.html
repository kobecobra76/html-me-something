                        <h2>The Age of Cars</h2>
                        <p>I rode bikes as a child but stopped riding when I was in high school because I believed the prevailing cultural
                     norm that cars were the only legitimate form of transportation.  
                     But when I went off to college I no longer had the use of the family car 
                     so I used some of the money I earned from a summer job to buy a Kobe Cobra 10 speed bike.</p>
                        <P>
                                I used this bike to get around Lawrence Kansas for a year or two until I acquired a used Chevrolet LTD.
                              This car would break down periodically so I would go back to riding the Kobe.  
                              I remember thinking that riding the bike felt better than rumbling around in the LTD but the 
                              cultural bias towards cars was so strong that I would go back to the LTD when it was fixed.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                                After school I took a job that was located in downtown Kansas City.  Most days I would ride the bus
                                 in order to avoid downtown parking fees.  The Kobe remained in storage because I thought that riding 
                                 on city streets was too dangerous.

                            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                            <p>
                                    In May of 2007 I began riding on a regularly.  There were a couple of factors behind this decision.  
                                    I had been active as a Sierra Club volunteer for several years working on environmental issues.  
                                    One of the events that we were involved in was the Green Commute Challenge that was put on every May.  
                                    During the challenge you logged the miles taken for any trip made walking, cycling or riding the bus.  
                                    The first year I walked but I was frustrated by the long time that it took to get to work and by the puny mileage 
                                    that I could log compared to the cyclists.   The second year I decided to put my fears of riding on city streets 
                                    aside and cycle to work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    I soon found that the dangers of urban riding were exaggerated and that I could ride to work in nearly the time
                                     it took to drive to work.  I continued riding after the challenge was over because I enjoyed it.  A second factor 
                                     was that I was thrown on to a mainframe to Unix conversion at work where I would be working long hours.  
                                     I might not have time to go to the gym but I still had to commute and the bicycle commuting provided at least 
                                     a base line of exercise.

                                    Coincidentally, 2007 was the first year of the Tour of Missouri, a high level professional bike race like 
                                    the Tour de France.  I participated as a spectator and volunteer.  This sharpened my interest in using cycling 
                                    as tool for fitness as well as transportation. During  subsequent years of the Tour of Missouri I met a number of 
                                    famous professional riders including Mark Cavendish who at the time was the fastest sprinter in the world, 
                                    reaching speeds of over 50 mph on flat ground.  Though not quite as dominant he remains in the top rank of 
                                    sprinters today.

                            <h2>Ice Biking</h2>
                            <p>
                                    As the weather turned cold at the end of 2007, I assumed that I would go into an "off season" for outdoor cycling.  
                                    It so happened that Kansas City was hosting the Cyclocross National championships that year.  Cyclocross is a form 
                                    of off road bike racing that is done on the grass of city parks and involves the riders dismounting their bikes to 
                                    jump over barriers.  I didn't know anything about cyclocross but I decided to go watch because it gave me an excuse 
                                    not to attend a tedious company Christmas party.  By the third day of the competition the grass on the course had 
                                    been completely chewed up.  It had turned colder and snowed the night before.  During early afternoon the masters 
                                    were riding on a course that consisted of two inches of slimy mud covering frozen ruts.  I saw men in their mid 
                                    seventies racing at a good clip under these conditions.  I decided if these guys can race on this then I can 
                                    ride all winter.

                            <p>
                                    Riding a bike has allowed me to explore many parts of the city that would never see by foot or car.  
                                    A car moves to quickly and limits your vision to your surroundings.  Going on foot is too slow.  
                                    I have been by bike to many of the industrial parts of town like the east and west bottoms.  
                                    I have traveled through many kinds of neighborhoods ranging from Mission Hills and other wealthy areas 
                                    to routes along railroad tracks and rivers that are dotted with homeless camps.  I was in the 
                                    "Heat Stroke Alley Cat Race"  where temperatures were at 107 degrees. I also an after party 
                                    for the New York Bicycle Film festival that was held in the basement of a dumpy bar in Greenwich Village 
                                    where most of the people were wild eyed bike messengers drinking copious amount of free Red Bull and 
                                    Greygoose vodka.  I have also cycled in many cities including Denver, New York, Chicago and Minneapolis.

                                    I plan on continuing to ride indefinitely.
